# Privacy Policy

The addon contains an auto-update mechanism that automatically updates the Chrome User Agent strings based on the currently released Chrome version. The API it downloads the info from [only provides the version number](https://chrome-mask-remote-storage.0b101010.services/current-chrome-major-version.txt), nothing else, so no evil code injection is possible.

The version number endpoint is hosted by [bunny.net](https://bunny.net/), a European CDN provider - so your traffic data is covered by the GDPR. IP addresses are logged only in an anonymized way with the last octet removed, and traffic logs are kept for only three days.
